# AMD MI300X Optimizations for xLSTM Kernels

This document outlines the optimization work done for xLSTM kernels on AMD MI300X hardware.

## Benchmark Results

We have conducted extensive benchmarking to identify where our AMD-specific optimizations provide the best performance improvement. The results vary significantly based on batch size, sequence length, and head dimension.

### Head Dimension 64

For models with head dimension 64, we've found the following optimal configurations:

| Batch Size | Sequence Length | Best Kernel Type | Speedup |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| 1          | 2048            | Native           | -       |
| 1          | 4096            | Native           | -       |
| 2          | 2048            | AMD-optimized    | 1.17x   |
| 2          | 4096            | Native           | -       |
| 4          | 2048            | AMD-optimized    | 1.11x   |
| 4          | 4096            | AMD-optimized    | 1.08x   |

### Head Dimension 128

Similar patterns were observed for head dimension 128, with the AMD-optimized kernels providing better performance in specific configurations.

## Automatic Kernel Selection

We've implemented an automatic kernel selection system in `mlstm_kernels.triton.amd_batch_aware` that chooses the optimal kernel based on the input dimensions.

Example usage:

```python
from mlstm_kernels.triton.amd_batch_aware import get_optimal_kernel_config

# Get the optimal kernel configuration for your specific scenario
batch_size = 4
seq_len = 2048
head_dim = 64
kernel_config = get_optimal_kernel_config(batch_size, seq_len, head_dim)

# Use these settings in your xLSTM configuration
xlstm_config = xLSTMLargeConfig(
    embedding_dim=embedding_dim,
    num_heads=num_heads,
    num_blocks=num_blocks,
    vocab_size=vocab_size,
    **kernel_config
)
```

## Implementation Details

The AMD-specific optimizations focus on:

1. **Block Size Selection**: We've tuned block sizes for specific configurations to match AMD MI300X hardware characteristics.
2. **Kernel Selection**: For certain batch sizes and sequence lengths, Triton kernels outperform native implementations.
3. **Grid Configuration**: We provide GPU grid configurations optimized for AMD hardware.

## Future Work

Opportunities for additional optimizations:

1. Expand the optimization to cover more configurations
2. Implement AMD-specific BLAS optimizations for matrix multiplications
3. Further tune GEMM configurations for head dimensions other than 64 and 128
4. Implement advanced memory access patterns optimized for AMD's cache hierarchy

## Testing

Two main test scripts are provided to validate the optimizations:

1. `test_xlstm_hybrid.py` - Tests various kernel configurations side by side
2. `test_xlstm_auto.py` - Tests the automatic kernel selection system

Both scripts can be used to benchmark performance on your specific hardware configuration.
