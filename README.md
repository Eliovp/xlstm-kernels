# mLSTM Kernels

In this repository we collect clean implementations of the different mLSTM formulations.

## Next steps

- [ ] integrate memory tracker for kernels for measuring GPU memory during speed tests



## Questions about Nsight Systems & Nsight Compute

- How can I organize the workflow efficiently in project. 
- How can I compare to baselines efficiently.
